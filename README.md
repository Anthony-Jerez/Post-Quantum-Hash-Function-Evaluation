# Post-Quantum Hash Function Novel Implementation and Security Analysis

## Overview 
This project contains code for a neural network-based approach to predict input sequences from output sequences of a proposed post-quantum hash function. The goal was to evaluate its security properties using a machine learning approach.

## Hash Function Research Paper
The proposed post-quantum hash function is associated with this research paper: [Post-Quantum Hash Function Proposal Paper ](./README_attachments/Post-Quantum-Hash-Function.pdf)
